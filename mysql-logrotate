#mysql-logrotate script for rotating various MySQLlogs like error,slow,general logs.

########################################### OPTIONS ##########################################################
#     ifempty
#       Rotate the log file even if it is empty, overriding the notifempty option (ifempty is the default).

#     minsize <size>
#       Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than size bytes, but not before the additionally
#       specified time interval (daily,  weekly,  monthly,  or  yearly).
#       The related  size  option  is similar except that it is mutually exclusive with the time interval options,
#       and it causes log files to be rotated without regard for the last rotation time.
#       When minsize is used, both the size and timestamp of a log file are considered.

#     missingok
#       If the log file is missing, go on to the next one without issuing an error message. See also nomissingok.
#      monthly
#        Log files are rotated the first time logrotate is run in a month (this is normally on the first day of the month).
#      rotate count
#        Log files are rotated count times before being removed or mailed to the address specified in a mail directive.
#         If count is 0, old versions are removed rather  than rotated.
#      size <size>
#        Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger then size bytes. If size is followed by k, the size is assumed
#        to be in kilobytes.  If the M is used, the size is in megabytes, and if G is used, the size is in gigabytes.
#        So size 100, size 100k, size 100M and size 100Gare all valid.
# Refer logrotate man page or option for more options.
